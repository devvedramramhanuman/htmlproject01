    Biology is the scientific study of life.It is a natural science with a broad scope but has several unifying themes that tie it together as a single,coherent field.For instance,all organisms are made up of cells that process hereditary information encoded in genes,which can be transmitted to future generations.Another major theme is evolution,which explains the unity and diversity of life.Energy processing is also important to life as it allows organisms to move,grow,and reproduce.Finally,all organisms are able to regulate their own internal environments.

Biologists are able to study life at multiple levels of organization,from the molecular biology of a cell to the anatomy and physiology of plants and animals,and evolution of populations.Hence,there are multiple subdisciplines within biology,each defined by the nature of their research questions and the tools that they use.Like other scientists,biologists use the scientific method to make observations,pose questions,generate hypotheses,perform experiments,and form conclusions about the world around them.


Life on Earth,which emerged more than 3.7 billion years ago,is immensely diverse.Biologists have sought to study and classify the various forms of life,from prokaryotic organisms such as archaea and bacteria to eukaryotic organisms such as protists, fungi, plants, and animals.These various organisms contribute to the biodiversity of an ecosystem,where they play specialized roles in the cycling of nutrients and energy through their biophysical environment.

<h3 style="font-size: xxx-large; font-style: oblique;">History Of Biology </h3>
<p style="font-size: x-large;">
The history of biology traces the study of the living world from ancient to modern times. Although the concept of biology as a single coherent field arose in the 19th century, the biological sciences emerged from traditions of medicine and natural history reaching back to Ayurveda, ancient Egyptian medicine and the works of Aristotle, Theophrastus and Galen in the ancient Greco-Roman world. This ancient work was further developed in the Middle Ages by Muslim physicians and scholars such as Avicenna. During the European Renaissance and early modern period, biological thought was revolutionized in Europe by a renewed interest in empiricism and the discovery of many novel organisms. Prominent in this movement were Vesalius and Harvey, who used experimentation and careful observation in physiology, and naturalists such as Linnaeus and Buffon who began to classify the diversity of life and the fossil record, as well as the development and behavior of organisms. Antonie van Leeuwenhoek revealed by means of microscopy the previously unknown world of microorganisms, laying the groundwork for cell theory. The growing importance of natural theology, partly a response to the rise of mechanical philosophy, encouraged the growth of natural history (although it entrenched the argument from design).

Over the 18th and 19th centuries, biological sciences such as botany and zoology became increasingly professional scientific disciplines. Lavoisier and other physical scientists began to connect the animate and inanimate worlds through physics and chemistry. Explorer-naturalists such as Alexander von Humboldt investigated the interaction between organisms and their environment, and the ways this relationship depends on geography—laying the foundations for biogeography, ecology and ethology. Naturalists began to reject essentialism and consider the importance of extinction and the mutability of species. Cell theory provided a new perspective on the fundamental basis of life. These developments, as well as the results from embryology and paleontology, were synthesized in Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection. The end of the 19th century saw the fall of spontaneous generation and the rise of the germ theory of disease, though the mechanism of inheritance remained a mystery.

In the early 20th century, the rediscovery of Mendel's work in botany by Carl Correns led to the rapid development of genetics applied to fruit flies by Thomas Hunt Morgan and his students, and by the 1930s the combination of population genetics and natural selection in the "neo-Darwinian synthesis". New disciplines developed rapidly, especially after Watson and Crick proposed the structure of DNA. Following the establishment of the Central Dogma and the cracking of the genetic code, biology was largely split between organismal biology—the fields that deal with whole organisms and groups of organisms—and the fields related to cellular and molecular biology. By the late 20th century, new fields like genomics and proteomics were reversing this trend, with organismal biologists using molecular techniques, and molecular and cell biologists investigating the interplay between genes and the environment, as well as the genetics of natural populations of organisms.
